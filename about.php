                    <h2>About Avion</h2>
                    <p>We at Avion have been satisfying collectors for over 70 years, having been established in 1948 by Ken West. The current owners, Roger and Sue West,
                        have taken the family business to
                        new levels catering for the specialist and thematic collector while actively encouraging youngsters and promoting philately where ever possible. In 2021,
                        the business received the Central England Prestige Award for excellence. Here's a little background about the current owners and the business.</p>

            <h4>ROGER WEST</h4>
            <p>Roger is a well-known philatelist and an acknowledged expert in the stamps of St Helena. In 1994 he edited the handbook 'Madame
                Joseph Forged Postmarks', which has been widely acclaimed as one of the most important philatelic reference works. Roger
                has a number of displays that prove popular when shown to Societies all over the United Kingdom, namely St Helena Forgeries, Tete-Beche,
                Dominica, Specimen Stamps and his highly acclaimed 'An Evening Wasted'. Outside of philately, Roger enjoys good music (mainly Jazz, Classical,
                Country and Easy Listening) and has taken up playing the keyboard in recent years. His other passion is cooking - Chinese cuisine being his forte.</p>
            <h4>SUE WEST</h4>
            <p>Sue has been Roger's wife and partner for forty-five years and plays an important role in running the business. Sue collects
                shells on stamps and enjoys 'popular' music, but her main hobby is patchwork and quilting.</p>
            <h4>THE BUSINESS</h4>
            <p>Our unrivalled stock is vast by any standard, boasting over 100,000 items. This stock includes basic stamps (mint, used and on cover), some of the more difficult Gulf States and a fine range of 'Locals'. We also include a superb selection of errors, varieties and proofs - an area of philately with which we have become renown. In more recent times, we have introduced postmarks and slogans and an interesting selection of forgeries. All in all, a stock with items for all collectors.</p>
            <p>Being so vast, the Avion Thematic stock is methodically listed on the Apple-Mac computer and so arranged that each item may be called up by Country or Theme. If you were interested in 'Birds', for example, your list would contain over 7,500 items. If you wanted only 'Birds of Prey", this would be reduced to 1,950 items, and if you confined your interest to just 'Owls', you'd have a list of 1,120.</p>
            <p>Each item is fully described and identified with a catalogue number (usually Stanley Gibbons, but maybe Michel or Scott). There will also be our reference number, and this is all you need to quote if placing an order. For your convenience, we accept payment by credit cards, personal cheques (UK Sterling only), Paypal, bank drafts (drawn on a UK bank) or cash in Sterling, US Dollars or Euros.
            </p>
            <p>All orders are dispatched the day they are received (except during holiday periods) and are sent fully insured in well-protected envelopes.</p>
            <p>We are active members at local philatelic societies and sponsored the 'Phoenix Trophy Competitionâ€™ for 25 years. Our collective knowledge is always at the disposal of anyone who asks. We will be happy to serve you in any way we can.</p>
            <p>So if you have a query on any aspect of philately, we will be happy to help - albeit what to collect, how to arrange your collection or perhaps what to invest in, please contact us by clicking <a href="contact-us.php">here.</a></p>
            <h4>OUR MISSION</h4>
            <p>By offering an unrivalled stock, collectors can see the scope and depth of their hobby.</p>
            <h4>OUR VISION</h4>
            <p>To continue to provide the same service that has se t us apart for over 70 years. In the very near future, we hope to bring our daughter Kim into the business where her management skills will guide the business into our Centenary.</p>
